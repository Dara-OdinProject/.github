## Hi there 👋
Every project I have done following the Odin Project is stored here! Each repository can be found in this organization - and with it my entire commit history as I was completing the Odin Project.
## What is the Odin Project?
The Odin Project is, as stated on their [GitHub](https://github.com/TheOdinProject):
> The Odin Project (TOP) is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. We help users learn the skills and build the impressive portfolio of projects they need to get hired as a web developer.

The curriculum is constantly updated by a team of professional software developers who both ensure the content is up-to-date and high quality.

As stated on The Odin Project's [website](https://www.theodinproject.com/):
> This is the website we wish we had when we were learning on our own. We scour the internet looking for only the best resources to supplement your learning and present them in a logical order.

## Feel free to look around! 😁
If you are interested in seeing my original code, there are many interesting projects here!
